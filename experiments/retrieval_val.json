These include resistance to the current antifungal treatment, a secondary infection, improper application of the medication, insufficient duration of treatment, or possible re-infection or exacerbation due to environmental factors or personal hygiene habits.\n\nIn clinical practice, an antifungal drug can take several weeks to be effective, and treatment needs to be continued for some time even after symptoms have improved to ensure that the infection is fully eradicated. It's not uncommon for fungal infections in moist areas like the groin to require extended treatment. The specific time frame can vary depending on the individual case and the extent of the infection.\n\nThe physician's advice to use bifonazole spray followed by terbinafine hydrochloride cream is a typical regimen for treating tinea cruris, as both medications possess antifungal properties effective against dermatophytes, which are the typical fungi causing tinea cruris.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that without a physical examination, direct consultation, and possibly laboratory tests (KO H preparation, culture, or biopsy), a definitive diagnosis cannot be made.
